To make sure our room labels are all tested, we made a test TestRoomNames(),
that tests all of the rooms on our board. These include the following
	Chapter
	Game Room
	Bedroom
	Lavatory
	Sauna
	Theater
	Atrium
	Roof
	Deck
	
We made a test called testRoomCharacteristics
^FILL THIS OUT CADEN^

We made a test called checkRowsCols(), which tests that the dimensions of the board are 25 x 25.

We also made a test to test the 4 door directions. This tested the following
	A left doorway pointing to the Roof
	A right doorway pointing to the Atrium
	A upwards doorway pointing to the Sauna
	A downwards doorway pointing to the Theater
