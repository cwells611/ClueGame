To make sure our room labels are all tested, we made a test TestRoomNames(),
that tests all of the rooms on our board. These include the following
	Chapter
	Game Room
	Bedroom
	Lavatory
	Sauna
	Theater
	Atrium
	Roof
	Deck

We made a test called checkRowsCols(), which tests that the dimensions of the board are 25 x 25.

We also made a test to test the 4 door directions. This tested the following
	A left doorway pointing to the Roof
	A right doorway pointing to the Atrium
	A upwards doorway pointing to the Sauna
	A downwards doorway pointing to the Theater
	
	
We made a test named initialTest. We chose 8 random cells across the board, and checked that the initial
for that cell is correct.

We made a test named testCenterLabel. This tests each room to verify that the label cell and center cell
are in the correct positions. This tested the following (all) rooms
	Chapter
	Game Room
	Bedroom
	Lavatory
	Sauna
	Theater
	Atrium
	Roof
	Deck
